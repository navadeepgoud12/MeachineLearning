# MeachineLearning

A curated collection of Machine Learning algorithms, notebooks, and mini-projects.  
This repo serves as a personal ML sandbox — for learning, practicing, and building ML models from scratch.

## 📚 What’s Inside

- **Algorithms** — implementations of basic & advanced ML algorithms (regression, classification, clustering, etc.).  
- **Notebooks & Scripts** — cleanly coded Jupyter notebooks / Python scripts with step-by-step implementations.  
- **Projects / Experiments** — mini-projects or practice projects exploring different ML tasks (prediction, classification, clustering, etc.).  
- **Notes & Records** — experiment logs, observations, model comparisons, learning notes, etc.

## 🎯 Purpose

- To provide a holistic ML learning environment — code, experiments, and results all in one place.  
- To build a base of reusable algorithms and templates for future ML–based work.  
- To practice ML workflows: data loading, preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and experimentation.  
- To maintain a log of learning and evolution over time.

## 🛠️ Usage / How to Explore
